        <h1>Ever think to yourself, "I'm so glad goats exist!"?</h1>

        <p>Yeah, me neither, really. Not that I have anything against goats. I just don't really think 
        about them that often. <br>They're not a regular part of my life. <br>I don't live on a farm.
        <br>Most of the meat I eat comes from other sources. <br>Really, I could probably go multiple years 
        without a goat interaction in any way, shape, or form.</p>

        <p>So it's strange when I remember - If it weren't for goats, my life would be so much worse. 
            I bet at least a quarter of all the people who may read this would say the same.</p>

        <p>But I'm getting ahead of myself.</p>

        <h3>Yes, goats have changed the world!</h3>

        <p>It all started, or so I'm told, about 1150 years ago.</p>

        <p>In the 9th century, an Ethiopian goatherd was out in the fields caring for 
            his herd when he noticed that the goats seemed to have a lot more energy than usual.</p>
        
        <p>Like any good researcher would do, our goatherd went to inspect the 
            situation more closely. After gathering some data, he realized that 
            the goats had been licking the red berries of a nearby shrub.</p>
        
        <p>We don't know if it was the long days in the sub-Saharan sun, 
            a desire to identify more strongly with his animals, or mere curiosity,
            but our adventuresome goatherd decided to try some of those berries himself.
            Like the goats, he found himself more energized afterwards. Later, he shared 
            his discovery with someone at a nearby monastery, who ignorantly but fortuitously threw the fruits into a fire.</p>
        
        <p>It was the first time humans had ever roasted coffee beans, and it all goes back to Kaldi and his goats.</p>

        <h3>The St. Louis Connection</h3>

        <p>Had I led with the fact that our goatherd was named Kaldi, observant St. Louisans might 
            have guessed that this story was headed toward a coffee (read: happy) ending. There are eleven locations of 
            <a href="https://kaldiscoffee.com/" target ="_blank">Kaldi's Coffee shops</a> here, including their roastery.</p>
