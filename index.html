        <h1 class = "not-a-joke">Ever think to yourself, "I'm so glad goats exist!"?</h1>

        <p>Yeah, me neither, really. Not that I have anything against goats. I just don't really think 
        about them that often. <br>They're not a regular part of my life. <br>I don't live on a farm.
        <br>Most of the meat I eat comes from other sources. <br><span class = "not-a-joke">Really, I could probably go multiple years 
        without a goat interaction in any way, shape, or form.</span></p>

        <p>So it's strange when I remember - If it weren't for goats, my life would be so much worse. 
            I bet at least a quarter of all the people who may read this would say the same.</p>

        <p>But I'm getting ahead of myself.</p>

        <h3>Yes, goats have changed the world!</h3>

        <p>It all started, or so I'm told, about 1150 years ago.</p>

        <p>In the 9th century, an Ethiopian goatherd was out in the fields caring for 
            his herd when he noticed that the goats seemed to have a lot more energy than usual.</p>
        
        <p>Like any good researcher would do, our goatherd went to inspect the 
            situation more closely. After gathering some data, he realized that 
            the goats had been licking the red berries of a nearby <span class="bad-joke">shrubbery</span>.</p>
        
        <p>We don't know if it was the long days in the sub-Saharan sun, 
            a desire to identify more strongly with his animals, or mere curiosity,
            but our adventuresome goatherd decided to try some of those berries himself.
            Like the goats, he found himself more energized afterwards. Later, he shared 
            his discovery with someone at a nearby monastery, who ignorantly but fortuitously threw the fruits into a fire.</p>
        
        <p>It was the first time humans had ever roasted coffee beans, and it all goes back to Kaldi and his goats.</p>

        <h3>The St. Louis Connection</h3>

        <p>Had I led with the fact that our goatherd was named Kaldi, observant St. Louisans might 
            have guessed that this story was headed toward a coffee (read: happy) ending. There are eleven locations of 
            <a href="https://kaldiscoffee.com/" target ="_blank">Kaldi's Coffee shops</a> here, including their roastery. 
            They seem to have been one of the first craft roasters in the St. Louis region, which seems fitting given their namesake.</p>
        
        <p>Other tasty coffee providers in St. Louis that I know of: </p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><a href = "https://blueprintcoffee.com/">Blueprint Coffee</a> - located in the site of a former architecture office.</li>
            <li><a href = "http://cometcoffeestl.com/">Comet Coffee</a> - tucked off I-64, near STLCC-Forest Park.</li>
            <li><a href = "https://www.sumpcoffee.com/">Sump Coffee</a> - my personal favorite so far, where chemistry creates tasty liquids.<br>Seems to be the preferred LC coffee provider as well.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Taste Profiles</h3>

        <p class="bad-joke">"Coffee gets its varying tastes from the climate and soil where it grows." --Capt. Obvious, Book of Hesitations, Ch. 3</p>

        <p>When I worked at <a href = "starbucks.html">Starbucks</a>&reg;, I got a beginner's introduction to the different aspects of coffee tasting notes. 
            We used three main growing regions to distinguish various coffees on a large scale.</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Latin America</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Chocolatey</li>
                    <li>Nutty</li>
                    <li>A clean taste profile</li>                    
                </ul>
            <li>Africa</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Floral</li>
                    <li>Fruity - often citrus or deep berry flavors</li>
                    <li>My favorite coffees tend to come from eastern Africa</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Southeast Asian</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Bold</li>
                    <li>Earthy</li>
                    <li>Herbal</li>
                    <aside id = "inset" class = "not-a-joke">Weird fact: Starbucks Sumatra coffee and Schnucks Macaroni and Cheese make an amazing pairing!</aside></li>
                </ul>
        </ol>

    <p>The next time you taste something from your friendly neighborhood barista, I hope you'll notice more of the subtle flavors in your cup. 
        <span class="spacer bad-joke">--Unless it's Folgers. No subtlety there.--</span>        But if it's not Folgers (which probably wouldn't come from a barista anyway), you might be able to pick up on the different flavors, 
        and you'll hopefully have a better appreciation for the span of history that enabled you to enjoy such warm, steamy amazing goodness.</p>
